    "## The Model\n",
    "Initially, we create a simulation model. This will hold references to all the agents (Persons and Locations) so that it can actuate them in the simulation phase. The agents also hold a reference to the model, so that they can access its global model parameters such as current (simulated) date. The model is initialized with the starting date (and time if necessarry) and the resolution of the simulation, we will choose one hour here. Also we are seeding the random engine to see the same results."

    "There are two fundamental building blocks for creating a synthetic world. Locations and Persons. Each person has a home location and may go to other locations acording to an itinerary. You need to create a home location before you create a person, because you need to specify their home location when creating a person. Each location has an `infection_probability`, which is the probability that a susceptible person is infected by an infectious person in that same location within a time step (given in the model's `sim_time_step`). The reason that the probaility is tied to the location is that locations often dictate how close people are to each other but also which social interactions they have.\n"

    "We can use some functions to make it easier to build our world. The simple `create_family` function creates a home location with a number of people living there. No gender or age of the persons are given, this is fine for simple simulations. Note that the function automatically adds the agents to the simulation model. Another experimental function `create_family_prob` is also available, this assigns a random number of parents and childern acording to a given distribution with random ages also sampled from distributions. For this tutorial, however, we will stick to the simple function."
